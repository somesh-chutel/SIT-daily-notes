                        SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
					 
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

INNER JOIN Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SQL INNER JOIN Example
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer information:

Example:

CREATE VIEW xyz AS SELECT employee2.name , emp4.college FROM employee2 INNER JOIN emp4 ON employee2.id = emp4.id;

Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

                           JOIN Three Tables
					   
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:

Example:

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);

                               Table 1                     Table 2 

                               Id (P1)                     Id (P2)

                               P1 --> Table 1 --> Primary Key for table 1

                               p1 --> Table 2 --> Foreign Key For table 2
