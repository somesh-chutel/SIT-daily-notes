                       The SQL LIKE Operator
					   
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

% _ The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters.



_   - The underscore represents a single character

Note: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).

The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

LIKE Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column LIKE pattern;

id,name,add,age



Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:
