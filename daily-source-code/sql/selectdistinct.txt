                        The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement

The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

Syntax:

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Example:

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
