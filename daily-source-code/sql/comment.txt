                            SQL Comments
							
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.



Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with --.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).

Example

--Select all:
SELECT * FROM Customers;

The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore the end of a line:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';
The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore a statement:

Example
--SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Products;
 
Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.

The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:

Example
/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Customers table:*/
SELECT * FROM Customers;
The following example uses a multi-line comment to ignore many statements:

Example
/*SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Products;
SELECT * FROM Orders;
SELECT * FROM Categories;*/
SELECT * FROM Suppliers;
To ignore just a part of a statement, also use the /* */ comment.

The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a line:

Example
SELECT CustomerName, /*City,*/ Country FROM Customers;
The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a statement:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE (CustomerName LIKE 'L%'

AND Country='USA'
ORDER BY CustomerName;
