                  SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
							   
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.


sr.no,name,lastname,age,location,gender,...id...10 ,12

CREATE VIEW Syntax:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the data, using the view's SQL statement, every time a user queries a view.


Example:

CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";     

We can query the view above as follows:

Example:
                                   
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];

The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price:

Example:

CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);

We can query the view above as follows:

Example:

SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price];
