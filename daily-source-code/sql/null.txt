                                  SQL NULL Values
								  
What is a NULL Value?

A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax:

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax:

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

                               The IS NULL Operator
							   
The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).

The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:

Example:

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NULL;
Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.

                               The IS NOT NULL Operator
							   
The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).

The following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:

Example:

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;
