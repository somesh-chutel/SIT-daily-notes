                    SQL Wildcard Characters

A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the SQL LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

   _ single char    % multiple char   Like ak%le

      SELECT * FROM xyz WHERE Name = "%y";

Using the % Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City containing the pattern "es": 

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%';

Using the _ Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "ondon":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any character, followed by "on":

Example

WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';
Using the [charlist] Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c":
