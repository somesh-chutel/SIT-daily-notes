               The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
			   
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.

The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.

The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

AND Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';

OR Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';

NOT Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany';

                          Combining AND, OR and NOT
						  
You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators.

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "München" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):

Example:               $150 - $2000

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA":

Example:


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany'; AND NOT Country='USA';
