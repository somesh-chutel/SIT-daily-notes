                              The SQL UPDATE Statement
							  
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax:

insert,select,delete,update,------->CURD OR CRUD

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!

UPDATE Table:

The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.

Example:

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

                                 UPDATE Multiple Records

It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records that will be updated.

The following SQL statement will update the contactname to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":

Example:

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan'
WHERE Country='Mexico';

                                       Update Warning!

Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!

Example:

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan';
